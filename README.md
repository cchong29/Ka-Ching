## Project Scope
A smart mobile app that helps users automatically track expenses, detect financial anomalies, and gain predictive insights into spending and investments.

Ka-Ching! is a smart financial tracker designed to simplify money management through automation and AI. By integrating banking and investment APIs, the app allows users to import and categorize their transactions automatically. It flags suspicious activity, analyzes spending trends, and delivers personalized, predictive insights to support both budgeting and investment decisions. With a secure social sharing feature, users can also collaborate on financial planning with trusted individuals. This tool is especially useful for busy professionals and young adults looking to stay financially informed with minimal effort.

## Motivation 
Managing personal finances effectively is a challenge for many individuals, especially with the increasing number of digital transactions and investment options available. Many existing financial management apps require manual data entry, which can be tedious and discouraging for users. Our project aims to automate and streamline financial tracking, providing users with intelligent insights to optimize spending and investment decisions effortlessly.

## Aim 
We hope to develop a Smart Expense & Investment Tracker that automatically imports and categorizes financial transactions, detects anomalies, provides spending trend insights, and offers investment performance analysis with predictive insights. By leveraging automation and AI-driven analytics, we aim to empower users to make informed financial decisions effortlessly.
